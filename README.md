# PyKu
A haiku project in progress

Descrition:

An app based on the one in Lee Vaughan's Impractical Projects (see https://github.com/rlvaugh/Impractical_Python_Projects). Most of the features and code are the same or similar to his, but novel features are being added.

Novel Features:
 
 a haiku syllable checker that allows for manual entry of new words into the word list (see haiku_check.py and missing_words_finder.py)
 (novel feature). haiku generation (not novel but will include my own features to this functionality down the road)
 

Main objective:

To improve familiarity/develop proficiency with git, github, nlp, python, markov analysis for text generation, file reading etc.
