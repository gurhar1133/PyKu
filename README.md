# PyKu
A haiku project in progress

Descrition:

A learning experience building an app based on the one in Lee Vaughan's Impractical Projects (see https://github.com/rlvaugh/Impractical_Python_Projects). Most of the code is the same as his, but novel features were added. This is primarily a learning exercise.

Novel Features:
 
 a haiku syllable checker that allows for manual entry of new words into the word list (see haiku_check.py and missing_words_finder.py)
 (novel feature). May make some tweeks to the haiku generation as well.
 
 will incorporate plagarism checker to see when the algorithm has plagarized from the dataset blatantly.
 

Main objective:

To improve proficiency with git, github, nlp, python, markov analysis for text generation, file reading, debugging etc.
